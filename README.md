# notesRollup
Are you frustrated that Notes on Person Accounts don't roll up to their respective Households in Salesforce Financial Services Cloud? You're not alone! In this video, I'll walk you through a practical solution to ensure that notes are visible at the Household level. While Salesforce currently does not support rollup of notes, I'll show you how to overcome this limitation and maintain a consistent, clean view of all important Notes for your clients' households. Say goodbye to manual workarounds and ensure your team has the full picture every time!

You can find the code shared during this video here. I would recommend deploying the APEX trigger to your sandbox first for testing. You can easily use chatGPT for test classes (Or please get in touch with me and I will be happy to provide those for you).
